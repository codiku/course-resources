[Info](In the next video I am going to explain in detail how the useEffect cleanup function work. I am actually showing this in a react project and not a react native project. (in a sandbox) But it does not really matter, the behaviour is exactly the same. The only thing that is really different is that <div> would be replaced by <View> in React Native for example. Anyway, we are going to practice what you are about to watch for real after the next video :))
